# M-NET-Thermostat
Smart thermostat for Mitsubishi's M-NET communication protocol

Massive thanks to Len Shustek for figuring out the protocol. This project largely builds on his work at https://github.com/LenShustek/M-NET-Sniffer

Project bundles a simulation of the M-NET to Serial converter - including conversion to 3.3V TTL logic in preparation for a Raspberry Pi to interpret the signals.
